# Overview of Students Exam Performances Dataset

This website explores the performance of students in exams using the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset. The dataset includes information such as student demographics, parental education levels, and exam scores in various subjects.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `gender`: Student’s gender (male/female)
- `race/ethnicity`: Race/ethnicity of the student
- `parental level of education`: Parent’s education level
- `lunch`: Type of lunch student received (standard/reduced)
- `test preparation course`: Whether the student completed a test preparation course (none/completed)
- `math score`: Score in math exam
- `reading score`: Score in reading exam
- `writing score`: Score in writing exam

## Initial Data Exploration

### Load necessary libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

students <- read.csv("data/StudentsPerformance.csv")

# Calculate summary statistics
summary_stats <- students %>%
  summarise(
    mean_math_score = mean(`math score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_reading_score = mean(`reading score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_writing_score = mean(`writing score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_math_score = sd(`math score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_reading_score = sd(`reading score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_writing_score = sd(`writing score`, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Print summary statistics
summary_stats

# Plot distributions of exam scores
students %>%
  gather(key = "subject", value = "score", `math score`, `reading score`, `writing score`) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = score, fill = subject)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(~ subject, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Exam Scores", x = "Score", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

students %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_math_score = mean(`math score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_reading_score = mean(`reading score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_writing_score = mean(`writing score`, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  gather(key = "subject", value = "mean_score", -gender) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = subject, y = mean_score, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Scores by Gender", x = "Subject", y = "Mean Score") +
  theme_minimal()

students %>%
  gather(key = "subject", value = "score", `math score`, `reading score`, `writing score`) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `parental level of education`, y = score, fill = subject)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Scores by Parental Education Level", x = "Parental Education Level", y = "Score") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
